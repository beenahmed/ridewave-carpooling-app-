# ridewave-carpooling-app
Ridewave is a carpooling app being developed for the Institute of Business Administration (IBA) in Karachi, Pakistan. The app aims to provide a convenient and eco-friendly way for users to share rides, reducing traffic congestion and lowering transportation costs.

Users can sign up and sign in using Firebase authentication, with all users required to have an email from the IBA Karachi domain. User profiles include information such as name, email, phone number, ERP (possibly an ID number), gender, and program of study.

The app allows users to browse available rides and post their own rides. Rides have details such as start and end locations, time, gender preference, price, and whether or not the car has air conditioning. Users can confirm their selection of a ride and receive notifications when a relevant ride becomes available.

The app also includes a feature for cars, where the car's license plate, model, seating capacity, and air conditioning operation can be recorded. This information can be used to ensure the safety and comfort of passengers.

Ridewave is being developed using Flutter, a UI toolkit from Google, and Firebase, a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform, also from Google. Firebase is being used for user authentication and storing application data, such as user profiles, rides, and cars. The app is expected to have features such as user registration and login, ride request and offer submission, notifications, ride search and sort, map browsing, ride ratings and reviews, user profiles, administrator access, and ride costing.
